# Image-Processing-Project
The proposed project is a Gate Access Control  System that automatically grants access to  vehicles based on their license plate numbers. 

When a car approaches the gate, a camera captures an image of the vehicle’s plate. The system then processes the image to extract the plate region, recognize the alphanumeric characters, and compare them to a predefined database of authorized vehicles.

If the plate matches an authorized entry, the system sends a control signal to open the gate (Activating a servo).Otherwise, it keeps the gate closed and optionally issues an alert or open another gate to exit the building/institution.
